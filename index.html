			Riders on the storm. 
			Riders on the storm. 
			Into this house we're born 
			Into this world we're thrown 
			Like a dog without a bone 
			An actor out alone 
			Riders on the storm. 
			There's a killer on the road. 
			His brain is squirming like a toad. 
			Take a long holiday 
			Let your children play. 
			If you give this man a ride 
			Sweet memories will die. 
			Killer on the road. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Girl, you gotta love your man. 
			Girl, you gotta love your man. 
			Take him by the hand 
			Make him understand 
			The world on you depends. 
			Our life will never end. 
			Girl, you gotta love your man.
