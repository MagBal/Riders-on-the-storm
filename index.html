			Riders on the storm.<br> 
			Riders on the storm.<br> 
			Into this house we're born<br> 
			Into this world we're thrown<br> 
			Like a dog without a bone<br>
			An actor out alone<br> 
			Riders on the storm.<br> 
			There's a killer on the road.<br> 
			His brain is squirming like a toad.<br> 
			Take a long holiday<br> 
			Let your children play.<br> 
			If you give this man a ride<br> 
			Sweet memories will die.<br> 
			Killer on the road.<br>

			Girl, you gotta love your man.<br> 
			Girl, you gotta love your man.<br> 
			Take him by the hand<br> 
			Make him understand<br>
			The world on you depends.<br> 
			Our life will never end.<br> 
			Girl, you gotta love your man.<br>
