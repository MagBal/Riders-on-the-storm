			Riders on the storm. 
			Riders on the storm. 
			Into this house we're born 
			Into this world we're thrown 
			Like a dog without a bone 
			An actor out alone 
			Riders on the storm. 
			There's a killer on the road. 
			His brain is squirming like a toad. 
			Take a long holiday 
			Let your children play. 
			If you give this man a ride 
			Sweet memories will die. 
			Killer on the road.
